            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Air Canvas is a hands-free digital drawing canvas which utilizes camera and OpenCV to recognize and map the hand gestures. we are using hand gesture recognition with the use of machine learning algorithm by using python programming, which creates natural interaction between man and machine. Hand tracking more specifically tracking the blue colored object technique is used as a tool of the computer acting as an external device similar to a keyboard and a mouse.</p>

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>The existing system only works with your fingers and no highlighters, paints, or relatives. Identify and distinguish something like a finger from RGB image without depth sensor great challenge. Another problem is lack of top and movement under the pen. The system uses a one RGB camera that you can overwrite. From the depths discovery is impossible, jobs up and down of the pen cannot be traced. So, everything finger path is drawn, and the result the image will be abstract and unseen by model.</p><br>
